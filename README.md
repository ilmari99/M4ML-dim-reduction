# M4ML-dim-reduction

In this project, we employed different dimension reduction methods, PCA, SVD, MIM, and CMIM, and compared the performance of RandomForest and kNN classifiers on a Turkish Music Emotion Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blaler/turkish-music-emotion-dataset).

The results show that RandomForest, with forward feature selection based on Mutual Information performs best in this task.
